### EmployeeSQL 

The data set is employee data of a corporation from the 1980s and 1990s contained in six CSV files.

In this project I will perform data engineering/modeling and data analysis in SQL by:

* Designing the tables to hold data in the CSVs
* Importing the CSVs into a SQL database
* Answer questions about the data
