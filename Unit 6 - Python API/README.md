###     Weather Py (API)

In this project, a Python script is used to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator using the OpenWeatherMap API. 

A series of scatter plots will showcase the following relationships:

* Temperature (F) vs. Latitude

* Humidity (%) vs. Latitude

* Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude

* Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
