## SQLAlchemy Activity - Surfs Up! 

The data set is weather data (temperature and precipitation) for various stations in Hawaii contained in two CSV files and one sqlite file. 

In this project, climate analysis will be performed using Python and SQLAlchemy (ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib). 

Next, a Flask API will be developed based on the climate analysis queries.
