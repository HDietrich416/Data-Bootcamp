# VBA-challenge
The VBA of Wall Street

Purpose: This project takes a large volume of daily Stock Market data for the years 2014-2016 and summarizes the results for each year based on ticker symbol, yearly change from opening to closing and % change from opening to closing. Formatting is also applied to change to percentage format and to highlight green(positive change) or red(negative change). 

Use: The VBA routines (3) are applied to the stock data in each worksheet in order to summarize and format the data. The VBA routines automate this big data analysis and can be applied to future years data.
