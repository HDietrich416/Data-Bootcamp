### The Power of Plots - Pymaceuticals Inc. 

* Pymaceuticals Inc. specializes in anti-cancer pharmaceuticals. In its most recent efforts, it began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.

* This project uses the complete data from the most recent animal study. In this study, 249 mice identified with SCC tumor growth were treated through a variety of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens. 

* All of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the study have been prepared in this project using Matplotlib and a high level summary of the results has been included.
