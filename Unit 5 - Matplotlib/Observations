Observations from Pymaceuticals Data:

1. Between the following four drug treatments (Ramicane, Capomulin, Infubinol, and Ceftamin), Infubinol and Ceftamin have the highest final tumor volume. 

2. Over time, on a mouse sample treated with Capomulin, this mouse (s185) showed a decrease in tumor volume. 

3. For mice treated with the Capomulin regimen, there is a strong positive correlation (correlation = 0.84) between average tumor volume and mouse weight.
